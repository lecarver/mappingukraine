# Mapping Social Media in the Russia-Ukraine Conflict
This project will aim to look at spatial trends in conflict and social media in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The goal will be to explore if there is a relationship between instances of conflict and when, where, and at what magnitude social media posting about the conflict occurs within the conflict zone of Ukraine. By mapping this phenomenon, we can bring insight to the behaviors of social media users during conflict, and specifically those users directly impacted by conflict. Understanding how populations living in conflict zones interact with social media can inform how to communicate important information to affected populations, such as humanitarian and relief aid or evacuation and other safety notifications, as well as utilize social media platforms to bridge between government and people
